' Set @total = 0 ' : this line is setting variable @total to 0.

' Set @total = @total + 1 ' : this line incrimment the @total variable with 1.

' Select @total ' : this line is select the variable @total.

so this code is initialize a variable with 0 and then increment it with one then select and display the value of it.
